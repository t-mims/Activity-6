    <p>Wolves are considered to have a strong spiritual energy, be very family or pack oriented, and are misunderstood by many.
        They are naturally timid and don't typically attack people and can bond well with people when under the right conditions. 
        And as much as I also love dogs, one of the key features of a wolf that really makes them an apex predator (and is just a cool evolutionary fact
        ), is that they don't have an odor, even when wet!

    <p> Wolves have very small litters, typically just 3 pups. Pups are cared for, even if the biological parents are killed, so no pup is left behind. They also don't mate when 
        resources are limited. When mating occurs under suboptimal conditions, the 
        wolves commiting the act are typically disowned by the pack.
